Look at this retail shelf photo and count every visible product by type.

Return ONLY a JSON array with this exact structure:
[{"product_type": "product_name", "count": number}]

Remember:
- Use lowercase_snake_case for product names
- Count each visible unit accurately
- Return only the JSON array, nothing else
